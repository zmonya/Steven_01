File Servers and Their Importance

File servers simplify data management by centralizing storage, reducing 
duplication, and enhancing security through encryption, access controls, 
and backups. They ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
(CIA), making them essential for safeguarding operations against threats.

Cisco vs. Unmanaged Routers

Cisco routers, designed for scalable networks, offer advanced features 
like VPNs and QoS but require expertise. Unmanaged routers are simpler, 
cost-effective options for smaller setups. The choice depends on network 
complexity.

Disaster Recovery vs. ICT Continuity

Disaster recovery restores IT systems post-disruption using backups and 
failover. ICT continuity ensures services remain operational during 
disruptions, focusing on proactive measures. Both approaches are critical 
for resilience.
